Known issues::

Ideas for features::

	Find out how to edit cron table with gedit, and add that to the INSTALL file so people who don't know how to use vim can use gedit

	Make script check if it is being run by root, and exit if not. This should prevent the need for doing a chmod on the script, and chown already seems unnecessary, so I can remove those from the INSTALL file
